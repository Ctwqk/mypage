        <h3>The Study of Enhancing the Intelligibility of Speech Signals Based on Neural Network Models (Oct 2022 - Mar 2023)</h3>
        <p>
            Advisor: Professor Zhi Chen<br>
            Conducted literature-based research on noise suppression algorithms and neural networks.<br>
            Built the dataset of noisy signals with different signal-to-noise ratios using data from TIMIT and Noisex-92.<br>
            Used various feature extraction methods to capture the features of noisy signals and trained models for noise suppression.<br>
            Compared and selected the best feature extraction methods among Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, Spectrogram, and log-power spectrum.<br>
            Constructed neural network models and evaluated their suppression effects by comparing signal intelligibility, signal-to-noise ratios, and model complexity.
        </p>
    
        <h3>The Comparison Between Two DNN-Based Signal Suppression Methods (Feb 2022 - Mar 2022)</h3>
        <p>
            Advisor: Professor Thomas Sullivan<br>
            Mixed speech signals with Gaussian noise to obtain noisy signals and used mapping and masking methods for denoising.<br>
            Trained the model with noisy signals sampled at 16kHz and separated into 16-ms frames with 8-ms overlap.<br>
            Computed Short-Time Fourier Transform in NumPy to extract features of time-domain signals, then imported these features into the neural network to predict Ideal Ratio Masking (IRM).<br>
            Conducted inverse Fourier Transform to acquire time-domain signals.<br>
            Compared the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) of the processed audios to determine suppression effectiveness quantitatively.
        </p>
    
        <h3>The Study on the Semigroup Structure of Doubly Super-Stochastic Matrices (Mar 2021 - May 2022)</h3>
        <p>
            Advisor: Professors Zhi Chen and Tao Yang<br>
            Conducted a literature review on doubly sub-stochastic matrices, exploring idempotence, Green’s relations, and other properties.<br>
            Proposed properties of doubly super-stochastic matrices and their semigroup structure based on research findings.<br>
            Proved theorems, including the idempotence of doubly super-stochastic matrices.<br>
            As the team leader, organized offline meetings, assigned tasks, and oversaw the progress and outcome of report writing, PowerPoint preparation, and defense presentation.
